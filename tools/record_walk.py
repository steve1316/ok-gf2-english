"""Times WASD key presses, so a Crew Deck walk can be measured instead of guessed.

The Crew Deck is a walkable 3D area, so the bot reaches each station by holding movement keys for fixed durations. Those durations are settings, and the only
way to get them right is to walk the route by hand and measure it. Run this, walk from the Crew Deck entrance to a station, press Esc, and paste the line it
prints into the matching setting.

Usage, from the repository root:

    python tools/record_walk.py

Reads the key state straight from Windows rather than installing a hook, so it keeps working while the game holds focus, and needs no extra package and no
administrator rights.
